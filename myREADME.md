## Inspired from 
  - https://flowbite-svelte.com/docs/forms/file-inputI like the code but I want a component more self-sufficient in term of behavior and style; Don't want to add any css framework, even tailwind which seems very seductive, mainly because Im lazy and don't want to have to learn more than necessary; CSS is becoming a word by itself. One could argue that the HTML/CSS/JS standard will catch up with all these new ideas.
